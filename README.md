# Pokemon-Counter
This python script takes in the name of a Pokemon from a user. It then uses the API at https://pokeapi.co/ to find the type of the Pokemon, as well as what types that Pokemon is strong/weak against.

Some notes:
- Exception handling is very limited at this point
- The method of taking input may need to be changed in the file based upon how it is being run.
